# Game Of Chance

This is a project I made for an assignment in school. It is rock, paper, scissors as created to be played on your computer. Its application might be pointless but the code used to make it served as personal milestone for what I can accomplish with javascript.

## About

This project was meant to solidfy knowledge on how to use Javascript, CSS, and HTML all in conjunction with eachother. For this project I chose to recreate the well-known game, 'rock, paper, scissors'. Due to time constraint I was able to only develop the classic version of the game to be played against the computer. With more time I was intending on also designing a whole new take on the game. This mode would be called **Cards** and would feature a poker style approach where you would be dealt cards and use them effectively to compete against your opponent.
